## About the Project

**Xoom** is a personal journey to recreate the magic of 90s first-person shooters like Doom and Duke Nukem 3D.
This project uses 2.5D rendering techniques with polygon-based maps to build levels, rendered in 3D.

Born from nostalgia and challenge, this is a reconstruction of a lost C++ engine, now rebuilt in Python and documented step by step.

The long-term goal is to revive that gaming experience and use this project as a testbed for learning the Vulkan API, planning a future renderer migration.

### Main Features

- **Vector-Based Map Loading**: Levels defined by vertices grouped in sectors, using simple text files.
- **BSP Tree**: Binary Space Partitioning for efficient geometry management and rendering.
- **3D Rendering**: Projects a 2D map into a 3D environment.
- **Collision System**: Player and environment collision detection.
- **Modern Shaders**: GLSL shaders for the rendering pipeline.
- **Dynamic Lighting**: Dynamic lighting implementation for immersion.
- **Detailed Logging**: Logs events from map loading to rendering errors for easier debugging.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get a local copy of the project running.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3.11 or higher installed.

- **Python 3.11+**

### Installation

> **Recommendation:**  
> It is recommended to use a **virtual environment** to isolate project dependencies and avoid conflicts with other Python projects.

#### Create and activate a virtual environment

On Windows:
```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

On Linux/MacOS:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Once the virtual environment is activated, install dependencies and run the game as usual.

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Xardax88/Xoom
    cd Xoom
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the game:
   - On Windows:
       ```bash
       python main.py
       ```
   - On Linux/MacOS:
       ```bash
       python3 main.py
       ```

### Controls

In-game
- W: Move forward
- S: Move backward
- A: Turn left
- D: Turn right
- Q: Strafe left
- E: Strafe right
- ESC: Exit the game

In the main menu
- Enter: Select option
- Esc: Exit the game
- ‚Üë: Move up
- ‚Üì: Move down
- ‚Üê: Not implemented
- ‚Üí: Not implemented

### Map Format

```
# XMAP Format:
# Lines starting with # are comments and ignored by the parser.
#
SECTOR <floor_h> <ceil_h>
    TEXTURES <texture_wall> <texture_floor(optional)> <texture_ceil(optional)>
    <cord_x> <cord_y>
    <cord_x> <cord_y>
    ...
END

# Each sector is defined by SECTOR ... END and contains:
# floor_h: Sector floor height
# ceil_h: Sector ceiling height
# cord_x, cord_y: Vertex coordinates
# A TEXTURES subsection with the sector's textures, where:
# texture_wall: Wall texture for the sector
# texture_floor: Floor texture (if not specified, wall texture is used)
# texture_ceil: Ceiling texture (if not specified, wall texture is used)

PLAYER_START <x> <y> <ang>
# x, y: Player initial position
# ang: Player initial angle (in degrees)
```
