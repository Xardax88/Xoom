## About the Project

**Xoom** is a personal journey to recreate the magic of 90s first-person shooters like Doom and Duke Nukem 3D.
This project uses 2.5D rendering techniques (raycasting over a 2D map) and a polygon-based map system to build levels.

It was born out of nostalgia and challenge. Years ago, I developed a similar engine in C++, but the code was lost over time.
This is my attempt to rebuild it from scratch, applying new knowledge, this time in Python, and documenting every step on GitHub.

The long-term goal is not only to revive that gaming experience but also to use this project as a testbed to learn the Vulkan API, planning a future migration of the renderer.

### Main Features

-   **Vector-Based Map Loading**: Levels are defined using polygons and segments in simple text files.
-   **BSP Tree**: Binary Space Partitioning is used for efficient map geometry management and rendering.
-   **3D Rendering**: Projects a 2D map into a 3D environment, rendering walls with height and perspective.
-   **Collision System**: Simple collision detection between the player and environment walls.
-   **Modern Shaders**: Uses GLSL for the rendering pipeline.
-   **Detailed Logging**: Logs events from map loading to rendering errors to facilitate debugging.

### Built With

This project was made possible thanks to the following technologies:

-   [Python 3.11+](https://www.python.org/)
-   [PyOpenGL](https://mcfletch.github.io/pyopengl/)
-   [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/)
-   [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
-   [Pillow](https://python-pillow.github.io/)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get a local copy of the project running.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3.11 or higher installed.

-   **Python 3.11+**

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash

### Map Format

```
# XMAP Format:
# Lines starting with # are comments and ignored by the parser.
#
SECTOR <floor_h> <ceil_h>
    TEXTURES <texture_wall> <texture_floor(optional)> <texture_ceil(optional)>
    <cord_x> <cord_y>
    <cord_x> <cord_y>
    ...
END

# Each sector is defined by SECTOR ... END and contains:
# floor_h: Sector floor height
# ceil_h: Sector ceiling height
# cord_x, cord_y: Vertex coordinates
# A TEXTURES subsection with the sector's textures, where:
# texture_wall: Wall texture for the sector
# texture_floor: Floor texture (if not specified, wall texture is used)
# texture_ceil: Ceiling texture (if not specified, wall texture is used)

PLAYER_START <x> <y> <ang>
# x, y: Player initial position
# ang: Player initial angle (in degrees)
```
